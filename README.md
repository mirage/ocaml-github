## ocaml-github: GitHub APIv3 OCaml Library

[![OCaml-CI Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://ci.ocamllabs.io/badge/mirage/ocaml-github/master&logo=ocaml)](https://ci.ocamllabs.io/github/mirage/ocaml-github/)
[![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/doc-online-blue.svg)](https://mirage.github.io/ocaml-github/)

This library provides an OCaml interface to the [GitHub
APIv3](https://docs.github.com/rest/) (JSON). It is compatible with
[MirageOS](https://mirage.io) and also compiles to pure JavaScript via
[js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml).

It is [not yet complete](#api-support-coverage) but
[lib/github.atd](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-github/blob/master/lib/github.atd)
contains the data types that have been bound so far.

There are several tests and examples in
[lib_test](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-github/tree/master/lib_test)
for small bits of
functionality. [jar](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-github/tree/master/jar)
contains utility programs that use the [git jar](#git-jar) facility for
stored tokens.

If you are interested in easily using this library to listen for GitHub
web hook events, you should look at [dsheets/ocaml-github-hooks](https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-github-hooks).

## Debugging

Two environment variables will cause more debugging to be output:

    GITHUB_DEBUG=1   # API calls output to stderr
    COHTTP_DEBUG=1   # even more HTTP-level debugging

If using the bindings from the toplevel, you can also set `Github.log_active`
to `true` to get the same effect as setting the `GITHUB_DEBUG` environment
variable.

## `git jar`

Applications that use this library will need to save authorization
tokens locally, and the `Github_cookie_jar` module in
[unix](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-github/tree/master/unix) helps
handle this more naturally.  It maps local application name to an
authorization token so that the application can query the cookie jar at
runtime and use the resulting token in Github API calls.

The tokens are all stored in `$HOME/.github/jar/<name>`, where `<name>` is the
local name of the application.

A `git-jar` command will be installed to add, remove, and list the contents
of this cookie jar.

```console
$ git jar
```

...will display the man page.


```console
$ git jar make avsm rwo
Enter Github password: **********
Enter 2FA code from 'app': 172217
Github cookie jar: created /home/avsm/.github/jar/rwo
Created token rwo (236241): <token>
```

```console
$ git jar show avsm
Enter Github password: **********
Enter 2FA code from 'app': 001221
Cookie Name | ID       | Application                              | Note
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        rwo | 236241   | Real World OCaml (API)                   |
   <remote> | 340988   | Travis                                   |
```

Your Github application can now use it via the `Github_cookie_jar` module:

```ocaml
# #require "github.unix";;
# Github_cookie_jar.(init () |> Lwt_main.run |> get ~name:"rwo");;
- : Github_t.auth option =
Some
 {Github_t.auth_scopes = [`Public_repo];
  auth_token = "<token>";
  auth_app =
   {Github_t.app_name = "Real World OCaml";
    app_url = "https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations"};
  auth_url = "https://api.github.com/authorizations/236241";
  auth_id = 236241; auth_note = Some "rwo"; auth_note_url = None}
```

## Manipulate GitHub releases

The [Releases](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#releases) API in
GitHub cannot itself be synched via Git, so this command-line tool lets you
specify a source user/repo and destination user/repo pair, and copies all the
releases from one to the other.

The `git-sync-releases` binary can copy all the releases from one
repository to another for you.

```
$ git sync-releases mirage ocaml-uri avsm ocaml-uri
```

You can also associate binary files with any release, for example to
include pregenerated build files.  The `git upload-release` binary
will do this for you.

```
$ git upload-release mirage ocaml-uri v1.4.0 release.tar.gz
```
